# Mangastyle

UPDATE: Temporarily shutdown the site cuz I ran out of free tier on AWS.

UPDATE: It is with regret that Twitter API is no longer free since companies began abusing Twitter API en masse for training data for LLMsâ€”understandable. Side effect is smaller projects like mine can no longer get real-time data. However, before the shutdown I was able to get an impressive **414K+** viral manga-style art tweets! So this website is still of immense value to artists and those who love manga-style art.

Mangastyle uses the twitter api to gather data in real-time on manga-style art. It ranks the art based on the number of likes received and features detailed filtering so you can find the most recent trending art.
